base
> conceptual model:  draw elements on a canvas
+ one-liners
+ straightforward to extend to custom classes
+ no* dependencies
+ very flexible for ad hoc plotting needs or "non-standard" plots
    + eg, barycentric coordinates; scatterplot w/ marginal densities
- plots as side effects
- fill color is `bg`; point shape is `pch`
- "ugly defaults"

ggplot
+ conceptual model: grammar of graphics
+ facets
+ plots are first-class objects
> "pretty defaults"
    + better than base
    - low contrast
    - not color blind-friendly
    - grey background??!
+ themes and palettes
- only* for data frames
- huge gap between basic use and writing extensions
